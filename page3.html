        <h2>Tolkien's Influence on Rowling</h2>
        <img src= "media/rowling.jpg" alt= "Rowling Image" width= "100" height= "600">
        <p>J.K. Rowling's <em>Harry Potter</em> series is another example of modern fantasy 
            drawing inspiration from the world of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Tolkien 
            based his story around the general concept of the "Hero's Journey", 
            a literary technique that takes the protagonist of the story through 
            various developments and phases in the story. Frodo Baggins, the protagonist 
            of Tolkien's main work, goes through the "journey" by first being offered 
            a quest and denying the responsibilities, then accepting the quest and 
            following through. During the quest, Frodo loses his mentor for most of 
            the story, reaches a climactic conflict with an antagonist, and everything
            comes down to a resolution in which he learns a story. Harry Potter, the 
            protagonist and titular character of Rowling's saga goes through his exact 
            sequence as well, with a less obvious denial of responsibilities in the form 
            of pure shock that he is actually a wizard. This is not only similarity 
            between the two works regarding the protagonist. Tolkien specifically 
            created the hobbits to signify the underdogs, quite literally the "little 
            people" in life. Rowling does something similar by making her protagonist 
            not only a child, but an orphan who barely knows anything about the world 
            he belongs to. Both Frodo and Harry start off with the disadvantage of 
            being isolated and "small", and ending up victorious in the end. 
            In Sharon Black's journal piece in <em>Children's Literature in Education</em>, 
            she brings up the idea of the "child of destiny", or the "child hero". 
            Although Frodo is not quite a child when his journey beings 
            (being a hobbit in his mid-fifties by the time he leaves for his adventure), 
            he still has the innocence about the world he lives in compared to the much 
            older races such as elves and dwarves, so this concept applies to him as well.
