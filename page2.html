        <h2>Overview of J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>

        <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien did many other things in life other
            than writing the saga he is critically acclaimed for. 
            He was a professor at Oxford University and "taught Old English 
            language and literature" from the period in England between 450 
            and 1150 C.E. (Clair 63). While teaching at Oxford, he founded a club
            to encourage the reading and discussion of Icelandic stories (qtd. 
            Carpenter 119-120). Because of his love for Nordic, specifically Icelandic 
            lore, "Hobbit share many characteristics of the Icelanders of the famous 
            family sagas" (Clair 64). Prior to being a professor, he served during World 
            War 1, as well as World War II as a code breaker. It was his time fighting 
            in World War I that inspired him to create the land of Mordor: a hellscape
            of war-centered industrialism.
